       Lists or removes "gone" branches, that is, local branches which used to
       have an upstream branch on a remote which is now removed.

       This situation typically occurs in a pull request workflow where the
       upstream branch gets deleted on the server after merging a pull
       request, leaving the local branch from which the pull request
       originated in place.  ggiitt ggoonnee easily removes these left-over branches.
